# Kiro Usage Notes – Cloud Referee Project

## Purpose
Kiro was used to accelerate the development of a decision-support tool
that compares cloud services and explains trade-offs instead of giving
a single fixed answer.

## How Kiro Helped
- Generated initial project structure
- Suggested decision-rule logic
- Helped refine pros and cons for each service
- Assisted in creating weighted scoring logic
- Improved explanation clarity for trade-offs

## Example Prompts Used
- "Compare AWS EC2 vs AWS Lambda based on traffic and cost"
- "Design a referee-style tool that explains trade-offs"
- "Generate rule-based scoring logic for cloud services"
- "Improve explainability of decision output"

## Outcome
Using Kiro reduced development time and helped iterate quickly on
decision logic and explanations.
